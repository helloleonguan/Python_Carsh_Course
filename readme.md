## Book: Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes 

This repository contains all the scripts I created when reading this book and all the source code provided by the author.  
  
  
The book itself has 2 major components: a) Python syntax b) 3 read-world projects. 
I have currently gone through the first component and planning to complete those 3 projects very soon. Notice that I will not create new repository for those projects. They will just be in separate folders in this repository.  

* [Alien Invasion with Pygame](./project01_chap12-14)  
* [Data Visualization with matplotlib & Pygal](./project02_chap15_17)  
* [Web Applications with Django](./project03_chap18-20)
