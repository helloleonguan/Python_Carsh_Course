## Book: Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes 

This repository contains all the scripts I created when reading this book and all the source code provided by the author in [pcc-master](./pcc-master).  
  
  
The book itself has 2 major components: a) Python syntax b) 3 read-world projects. 
I have gone through the the whole book. I utilised the provided source code for helping me understand the structure and the contents of all 3 projects. 
  
Each individual project involves different packages & frameworks: 
* Alien Invasion - __Pygame__  
* Data Visualization - __matplotlib & Pygal__  
* Web Applications - __Django__
