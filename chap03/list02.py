# Sorting a list alphabetically is a bit more complicated when all the values are not in
# lowercase. There are several ways to interpret capital letters when youâ€™re deciding on
# a sort order, and specifying the exact order can be more complex than we want to deal
# with at this time. However, most approaches to sorting will build directly on what you
# learned in this section.
